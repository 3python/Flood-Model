Flood Model

The purpose of this model is to create a very basic model of how rain moves and accumulates across a landscape.
Because of the model's limitations, in that it does not consider evaporation or absorbtion into the soil
it is branded as a fairy dust model, opposed to a rainfall model.
The model works by autogenerating rainfall, storing this rainfall onto each cell of the landscape, then moving
half of the rain from each cell to the adjacent cell with the steepest downhill gradient.
The model is then run a number of times, each time half the amount of dust/water in each cell is moved to the 
adjacent cell to give a rough approximation of how water moves and accumulates across the landscape.
